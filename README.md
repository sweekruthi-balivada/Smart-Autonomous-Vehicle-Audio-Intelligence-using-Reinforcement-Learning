# Smart-Autonomous-Vehicle-Audio-Intelligence-using-Reinforcement-Learning
Intelligent AI systems for Driverless Vehicles. This project is focusses on different audio categories like Emergency sirens, In-vehicle event detection and Environment event detection. I have built this project using Transformer based architectures and combining them with Reinforcement learning to enhance the performance and precision

I have built 2 models with reinforcement learning to precisely detect emergency sirens and alert sounds in side and outside the vehicle.
